# Emily Kaneff's Offical Portfolio

##Overview

Hi! I'm Emily and welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find a variety of different projects I have completed over the course of my time at Full Sail University. Although I am more front-end focused, included are some more back-end projects since I am knowledgeable of full-stack development practices. I was the sole designer and developer on each of these projects unless otherwise specified in the description.

##Ladybug Game

For this project, the focus was to show use of different design patterns used in front end web programming as well as highlight different ES6 practices. I had about a week timeline to complete this project. The patterns used here were the singleton pattern, the factory pattern, as well as aggregation/composition.


##Laravel-NodeJS API

In this project, I was asked to use both the Laravel framework and Node.js to create an application that would allow for Laravel to return information from a database in JSON format as Node asked for it. The timeline for this was about 24 hours, and I had no previous experience using Restler to query a custom API, nor had I made a custom API.
