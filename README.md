# Emily Kaneff's Offical Portfolio

##Overview

Hi! I'm Emily and welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find a variety of different projects I have completed over the course of my time at Full Sail University. Although I am more front-end focused, included are some more back-end projects since I am knowledgeable of full-stack development practices. I was the sole designer and developer on each of these projects unless otherwise specified in the description.

##Ladybug Game

For this project, the focus was to show use of different design patterns used in front end web programming as well as highlight different ES6 practices. I had about a week timeline to complete this project. The patterns used here were the singleton pattern, the factory pattern, as well as aggregation/composition. 


##Laravel-NodeJS API

In this project, I was asked to use both the Laravel framework and Node.js to create an application that would allow for Laravel to return information from a database in JSON format as Node asked for it. 
The timeline for this was about 24 hours, and I had no previous experience using Restler to query a custom API, nor had I made a custom API. Needing to learn a new technology as well as figuring out a new concept in a fairly new technology was certainly a challenge, but I was able to finish within the deadline and walked away with lots of knowledge on all the different kinds of errors that Laravel throws when it doesn't understand what is trying to talk to it.

##Laravel Shopping Cart

This project was a team one where I along with one other person were required to make a fully functioning e-commerce application within about a week and a half. It was required to be done in the Laravel framework using the Stripe payment API. 
I was responsible for creating and designing the views, setting up user login and registration, as well initializing the routes and controllers. Bootstrap as well as my own custom CSS was used for the design work.
