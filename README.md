# Emily Kaneff's Offical Portfolio

##Overview

Hi! I'm Emily and welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find a variety of different projects I have completed over the course of my time at Full Sail University. Although I am more front-end focused, included are some more back-end projects since I am knowledgeable of full-stack development practices. I was the sole designer and developer on each of these projects unless otherwise specified in the description.

##Ladybug Game

For this project, the focus was to show use of different design patterns used in front end web programming as well as highlight different ES6 practices. I had about a week timeline to complete this project. The patterns used here were the singleton pattern, the factory pattern, as well as aggregation/composition. The biggest challenge here was figuring out how to get the rows of ants to move in different directions at different speeds at the same time, 


##Laravel-NodeJS API

In this project, I was asked to use both the Laravel framework and Node.js to create an application that would allow for Laravel to return information from a database in JSON format as Node asked for it. 
The timeline for this was about 24 hours, and I had no previous experience using Restler to query a custom API, nor had I made a custom API. Needing to learn a new technology as well as figuring out a new concept in a fairly new technology was certainly a challenge, but I was able to finish within the deadline and walked away with lots of knowledge on all the different kinds of errors that Laravel throws when it doesn't understand what is trying to talk to it.

##Laravel Shopping Cart

This project was a team one where I along with one other person were required to make a fully functioning e-commerce application within about a week and a half. It was required to be done in the Laravel framework using the Stripe payment API. 
I was responsible for creating and designing the views, setting up user login and registration, as well initializing the routes and controllers. Bootstrap as well as my own custom CSS was used for the design work. 

##Music API Project

The requirements for this project were to create an application using at least one API that would also implement full CRUD functionality as well as common design patterns within the programming. ES6 practices were also encouraged. 
I was again the sole designer and developer, and the timeline was about four weeks. I implemented MVC as well as custom events and event dispatching in order to handle the data received from the API. The biggest challenge I ran into while making this project was that the first API I tried to use returned invalid image URLs. This meant that I had to use one API to return to me musical artists based on genre, and then with that data I had to query another API to return new artist object with valid images. I accomplished this through various custom events that were triggered on success of each API call. This was also the first time I utilized local storage and jQuery UI.
